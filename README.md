# expotimecalc

This code has been written by me to complete an assignment for the Astrophysics Observation course
at University of Pisa. The course is held during the Academic Year 2020/2021 for the MSc in Physics
(Astronomy and Astrophysics).

It features and Exposure Time Calculator (hence the name), to be also used during the year for
planning of observations.
